Sometimes, when you're struggling with a problem, you find just the 
right reference to help clarify your thinking, or give you a new spin 
on how to approach it.

I love those moments. Here are some of the references that have given me
insights precisely when I needed them:

## General productivity:

* David Allen, [Getting Things Done](http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0142000280) (book) – do, delegate, defer, or dump the tasks you’re working on. Be aggressive in deciding what you aren’t able to care about right now, then move on to something else.

* [Isaac Asimov on Creativity](http://www.technologyreview.com/view/531911/isaac-asimov-asks-how-do-people-get-new-ideas/) (essay) -- creativity flourishes when people have the ability to share and explore random connections freely. Since most connections don’t pan out, setting up an environment that allows this to happen without judgment is critical (and hard)

* Richard Hamming, [You and Your Research](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html) (lecture) -- Have the courage, self-confidence and drive to work on important problems, even if that was small.

* Joel Spolsky, [The Law of Leaky Abstractions](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/LeakyAbstractions.html) (essay) -- Abstractions are good (except when they aren’t). Learn to tell the difference between good and bad, and spot the edge cases early. Recognize that we have to create abstractions and work at a high level to begin to understand a problem – but quite often those abstractions fall apart when you work through the implementation.

## People:

* Michael Lopp, [Managing Humans](http://www.amazon.com/Managing-Humans-Humorous-Software-Engineering/dp/1430243147) (book) – the first book I read that helped me understand what the hell managers do. Michael Lopp will show up again in this list; his blog (http://www.randsinrepose.com/) is fantastic and low-volume.

* Michael O. Church, [The 3-ladder system of social class](https://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2012/09/09/the-3-ladder-system-of-social-class-in-the-u-s/) (blog post) – a good reminder that not everyone thinks about their relationship to work and culture the same way I do. (His “What programmers want” essay is also good, though he *really* hates managers so keep that bias in mind.)

* Daniel Kahneman, [Thinking, Fast and Slow](http://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555) (book) – the best book I read in 2013, about biases our unconscious, pattern-seeking brain imposes on rational thought

* Keith Johnstone, [Impro](http://www.amazon.com/Impro-Improvisation-Theatre-Keith-Johnstone/dp/0878301178) (book chapter) – It’s not obvious why a book about improv and acting would be on the list. But his discussion of Status (chapter 2) completely changed how I think about conversational dynamics and is key reading before walking into a sales meeting.

* [Valve’s employee handbook](http://media.steampowered.com/apps/valve/Valve_Handbook_LowRes.pdf) (pdf)– their business is very different than ours; I don’t think full “open allocation” works, especially in a small company that has yet to figure out exactly what its market is. But it’s good nonetheless.

* Alistair Cockburn, [Characterizing people as non-linear, first-order components in software development](http://alistair.cockburn.us/Characterizing+people+as+non-linear,+first-order+components+in+software+development) (paper) – Classic (1999) paper about the characteristics of engineers (really, all creative people) that need to be designed into any system that forces them to work collaboratively. The conclusions aren't all that mindblowing, but the taxonomies are useful (specifically the tension between inventing and communicating, and between time spent maintaining software vs. maintaining the citizenship of the team).

* Jeff Haden, [4 Ways to Get a New Employee Off to the Perfect Start](http://www.inc.com/jeff-haden/4-ways-to-get-a-new-employee-off-to-the-perfect-start.html) (article) -- Your onboarding speech to a new employee should contain four things: (a) how your business/department creates value; (b) your internal/external customers; (c) their immediate goals and how they’ll get feedback; (d) what makes them unique (why you hired them, specifically).

## Organizations:

* Reed Hastings, [Netflix Culture](http://www.slideshare.net/reed2001/culture-1798664) (slideshow) – a solid encapsulation I’ve seen of a culture that values freedom over everything else. I don’t agree with everything this presentation says, but there’s a lot to like about it.

* Dave Logan et. al., [Tribal Leadership](http://www.amazon.com/Tribal-Leadership-Leveraging-Thriving-Organization/dp/0061251321) (book) – an interesting “five-stage” framework for looking at how people interpret their position in a team, company and product. There are some conflicts between how he approaches organizations and how Netflix does.

* Blake Masters, [Peter Thiel’s CS183 Startup class](http://blakemasters.com/peter-thiels-cs183-startup) (series of blog posts) – awesome notes about how to think about the growth of startups, their relationship to the larger business community, and how to make them grow.

## Business & product management:

* Michael Lopp, ["Bits, Features and Truth"](http://randsinrepose.com/archives/bits-features-and-truth/) (blog post) – the constant interplay between sales needs, engineering, and long-term thinking

* James Shore, [story card hell](http://www.jamesshore.com/Presentations/Beyond%20Story%20Cards.html) (blog post) -- useful mostly for the "funnel graphic" showing how specifications get more detailed over time.

* Gojko Adzic, [Specification by Example: How successful teams deliver the right software](http://specificationbyexample.com/) (book) – implementation detail about the above

* Jeff Patton, [Kanban development, oversimplified](http://www.agileproductdesign.com/blog/2009/kanban_over_simplified.html) (blog post) – Dnichols’ link that explained why we keep the whiteboards the way we do

* Eric Ries, [The Lean Startup](http://www.amazon.com/The-Lean-Startup-Entrepreneurs-Continuous/dp/0307887898) (book) – judging success entirely by revenue doesn’t work for growing companies with long sales cycles (i.e. ours); we need to know if we’re doing the right things by more tactical measures.

* Dan Ostlund, [The most basic things you need to know about sales](http://www.fogcreek.com/guide/The-most-basic-things-your-company-needs-to-know-about-sales.pdf) (pamphlet) – tell stories. Ask questions. Get concrete objections. Close.  For folks who've never done this, contains actual phrases you might want to try that are less scary than sales-sounding.

## Storytelling:

* Blake Snyder, [Save the cat!: The last book on screenwriting you'll ever need](http://www.amazon.com/Save-Last-Book-Screenwriting-Youll/dp/1932907009) (book, with explaining blog post at http://timstout.wordpress.com/story-structure/blake-snyders-beat-sheet/) – Never read the book, and you want to be careful not to follow the formula too closely. But when you're having trouble structuring a presentation or demo, it's good to review this and see what ideas it sparks.

* Dan Harmon on [Story Structure](http://channel101.wikia.com/wiki/Story_Structure_101:_Super_Basic_Shit) – another view of story structure. (1) a character is in a zone of comfort, (2) but they want something, (3) they enter an unfamiliar situation, (3) adapt to it, (4) get what they wanted, (5) pay a heavy price for it, (6) hen return to their familiar situation, (7) having changed... "Get used to the idea that stories follow that pattern of descent and return, diving and emerging. Demystify it. See it everywhere. Realize that it's hardwired into your nervous system, and trust that in a vacuum, raised by wolves, your stories would follow this pattern."

* Joseph Campbell, [The Hero with a Thousand Faces](http://www.amazon.com/Thousand-Faces-Collected-Joseph-Campbell/dp/1577315936) (book) – honestly, I haven't read this since my entire senior year of high school was built around analyzing it. But for complex, personality-driven stories, it's a classic. Self-doubt, venturing out into the unknown... matches (and predates) Dan Harmon and Blake Snyder, tying stories of today to myths throughout human history.

* Tomasz Tungus, [Inverted pyramid vs. engineering comms](http://tomtunguz.com/the-biggest-professional-challenge-of-my-career-communication/) (blog post) - Communicating to execs is very different than communicating to engineers. For engineers, the story is about discovery: what we sought to learn and how we learned it. For execs, the story is about the decision: "what needs to be done" is the highlight of the story, and the supporting facts and evidence recede into the background. Most of the time, you don't want to pull out your storytelling bag of tricks for executive meetings.

## Thinking like an engineer:

* Steven Levy, [The Hacker Ethic](http://www.amazon.com/Hackers-Computer-Revolution-Anniversary-Edition/dp/1449388396) (chapter 2 from Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution) – Principles about how to look at problems.

* Paul Hoffman (editor), [The Tao of IETF](https://www.ietf.org/tao.html), specifically the founding principles "We reject kings, presidents and voting. We believe in rough consensus and running code" and "Be conservative in what you send and liberal in what you accept."
