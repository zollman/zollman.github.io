## How to use it

Fork this repository to create your new website starting from this template.

## How to Create a CV Using the `cv.ts` File

The `cv.ts` file located in the `src/data/` directory is used to define the structure and content of your CV. This file exports an object containing various sections of your CV, such as education, experience, publications, and more.

### Example Structure of `cv.ts`

```typescript
export const cv = {
  education: [
    {
      degree: "Ph.D. in Computer Science",
      institution: "University of Example",
      year: "2020",
    },
    {
      degree: "M.Sc. in Computer Science",
      institution: "University of Example",
      year: "2016",
    },
  ],
  experience: [
    {
      title: "Research Scientist",
      company: "Example Research Lab",
      year: "2021-Present",
    },
    {
      title: "Software Engineer",
      company: "Tech Company",
      year: "2016-2021",
    },
  ],
  // Add more sections as needed
};
```

To create or update your CV, modify the `cv.ts` file with your personal information and achievements. The CV will be automatically rendered on the CV page of your website.

## How to Use the `settings.ts` File

The `settings.ts` file located in the `src/` directory is used to configure various settings for your Astro Academia website. This file exports an object containing settings such as site title, description, social media links, and more.

### Example Structure of `settings.ts`

```typescript
export const settings = {
  siteTitle: "Astro Academia",
  siteDescription: "A personal academic website built with Astro.",
  socialLinks: {
    twitter: "https://twitter.com/yourusername",
    github: "https://github.com/yourusername",
    linkedin: "https://linkedin.com/in/yourusername",
  },
  // Add more settings as needed
};
```

To customize your website settings, modify the `settings.ts` file with your desired values. These settings will be used throughout your website to display the appropriate information.

## Where to Find the Blog Collection and Where to Add New Blog Posts

The blog collection is located in the `src/content/BlogPosts/` directory. Each blog post is a Markdown file with a `.md` extension. The blog posts are named sequentially (e.g., `post1.md`, `post2.md`, etc.).

### Adding a New Blog Post

1. Navigate to the `src/content/BlogPosts/` directory.
2. Create a new Markdown file for your blog post (e.g., `post1.md`).
3. Add the content of your blog post using Markdown syntax. Include frontmatter at the top of the file to define metadata such as title, date, and tags.

### Example Blog Post (`post11.md`)

```markdown
---
title: "New Blog Post"
date: "2023-10-01"
tags: ["research", "astro"]
excerpt: "Some short paragraphs"
---

# New Blog Post

This is the content of the new blog post. Write your article here using Markdown syntax.
```

Once you have added the new blog post, it will be automatically included in the blog collection and displayed on the blog page of your website.

## Deploy
The template provides a workflow to deploy the website on Github pages as a static website.
