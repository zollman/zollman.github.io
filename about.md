I've been doing some form of security since 1995; after digging up a bug in
the Novell Netware system installed at my high school, the owner of the
company that built it offered me a job. Pete Giarrusso, his partner Bob
Thrush, and the rest of the team set up the first Internet Service Provider
in Orlando, right in the age of dial-up, and I got in on the ground floor
as their first tech support guy.

I can still remember the shock when reading Aleph One's [Smashing the Stack
for Fun and Profit](http://phrack.org/issues/49/14.html) in Phrack -
running the attached code and seeing a root prompt appear of out nowhere.
It was incredibly powerful. That idea of finding the hidden quirks of how a
system works - poking at it and observing its behavior - has stayed with
me. It carries through as an engineer, a security analyst, and even a
manager -- aren't people just another semi-predictable system?

Currently helping to build out a cloud security platform at a financial
services company in Connecticut. Always open to interesting technical
collaborations and ideas. Not particularly interested in hearing from
recruiters.
