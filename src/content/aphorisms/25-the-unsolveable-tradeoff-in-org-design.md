When should you use a ‚Äúmission-aligned‚Äù design, with independent organizations with their own P&L and distinct business problems vs. a ‚Äúfunction-aligned‚Äù design, built around depth in a skill area - data science, engineering, sales? Mission-aligned teams move faster, thanks to independence; but won't have a critical mass of functional expertise and duplicate work within a company. Function-aligned teams go deeper and are more efficient in their areas of support, but create bottlenecks that require complex coordination. Balance requires explicitly designing the interfaces between teams. [Team Topologies](https://teamtopologies.com/key-concepts) provides a framework: some hard boundaries that look like X-as-a-service interfaces; some teams facilitating others‚Äô work with a drop-in, consulting model; and sometimes combining disparate teams for a defined period of time to build something requiring deep collaboration.
