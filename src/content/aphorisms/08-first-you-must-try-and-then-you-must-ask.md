Trying is learning. Especially if youâ€™re a novice, working with more experienced colleagues. If youâ€™re stuck on finding a bug, figuring out a phrase, generating an insight, getting a tool to work - push yourself just past the point of being stuck. Take another 15 minutes to brainstorm ideas, develop tests, look for docs, and give it another shot. After that, write down what you tried and go ask for help. This has three great outcomes: First, youâ€™ll learn new techniques. Second, you'll blaze a path for someone stuck on a similar problem. And third, the expert can now help better: knowing what you tried leads to more targeted advice. Donâ€™t stay stuck forever; people love to help. But try, and then ask.
