description: "Trying is learning. Especially if you‚Äôre a novice at a topic, working with more experienced practitioners. If you‚Äôre stuck on finding a bug, figuring out a phrase, generating a new insight, getting a tool to work - push yourself past the point of being stuck. Take another 15 minutes to brainstorm ideas, come up with tests, search for related documentation, and give it another shot. Then, when you‚Äôve done that, write down what you tried and go ask for help. This has three great outcomes: First, you‚Äôre likely to learn new techniques. Second, you can blaze a path for the next person stuck on a similar problem. And third, the expert is in a better position to help you - because they can see what you tried, and provide more targeted advice. Don‚Äôt stay stuck forever - people love to help. But try, and then ask."

# First you must try, and then you must ask

Trying is learning. Especially if you‚Äôre a novice at a topic, working with more experienced practitioners. If you‚Äôre stuck on finding a bug, figuring out a phrase, generating a new insight, getting a tool to work - push yourself past the point of being stuck. Take another 15 minutes to brainstorm ideas, come up with tests, search for related documentation, and give it another shot. Then, when you‚Äôve done that, write down what you tried and go ask for help. This has three great outcomes: First, you‚Äôre likely to learn new techniques. Second, you can blaze a path for the next person stuck on a similar problem. And third, the expert is in a better position to help you - because they can see what you tried, and provide more targeted advice. Don‚Äôt stay stuck forever - people love to help. But try, and then ask.
