Then *celebrate your shot*: show off your work, and how it solves the problem. This last part is important - no one will pay as much attention to your work as you, but everyone loves to celebrate when something goes well."

# Call your shot, take your shot, celebrate your shot

Most of what we work on is complex enough that it’s hard to judge the quality from a quick glance. So for bigger projects, it’s important to build trust through time - and the best way to do that is to consistently say what you’re going to do - then do it. Call your shot: using “why, what and how” language, describe the project you’re about to undertake and why it solves a problem. Take your shot: do what you said, making adjustments - especially to the “how” - as necessary. Then celebrate your shot: show off what you did, and connect back to the problem it was supposed to solve. This last part is important - no one will pay as much attention to your work as you, but everyone loves to celebrate when something goes well.
