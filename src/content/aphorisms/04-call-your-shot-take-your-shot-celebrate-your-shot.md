Most work is complex enough that it’s hard to judge quality from a quick glance. For bigger projects, build trust through time: consistently say what you’re going to do - then do it. *Call your shot*: using “why, what and how” language, describe the project you’re about to undertake and why it solves a problem. *Take your shot*: do what you said, adjusting scope and process as needed. Then *celebrate your shot*: show off your work, and how it solves the problem. This last part is important - no one will pay as much attention to your work as you, but everyone loves to celebrate when something goes well.
