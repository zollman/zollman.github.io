# To be of use

“The people I love the best / jump into work head first / without dallying in the shallows /  
and swim off with sure strokes almost out of sight…” So begins Marge Piercy’s poem, reminding us not to align ourselves with “parlor generals and field deserters, but move in a common rhythm when the food must go in or the fire be put out.” Strategy and teaching are important, but be skeptical of strategists and thought leaders, or “a strategy” as a consulting deliverable: if we are here to solve real problems, and help real people, we can’t disconnect ourselves from the hands-on work, whatever it is. Build something real: if you find yourself devoting quarters to a study, a platform development effort, or a rebuild, strongly consider whether you can find a “thin vertical slice” that delivers value - and gets you feedback - faster.
