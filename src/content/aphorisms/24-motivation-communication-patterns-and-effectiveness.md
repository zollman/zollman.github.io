description: "[Tribal Leadership](https://www.amazon.com/Tribal-Leadership-Leveraging-Thriving-Organization/dp/0061251321) describes five “stages” that people - and by extension the “tribes” they sort themselves into - go through: (1) *life is unfair*, might as well get mine; (2) *my life sucks*, I should just keep my head down and try not to be bothered, (3) *I’m awesome* but everyone around me is an idiot, (4) *We’re amazing* *but* that other team is awful - let’s beat them; and (5) *We’re amazing* and can change the world. Leaders who spot and use these patterns effectively create better, more motivated teams: for example, give small stage 2 clusters a win and watch them grow by having ownership. Show stage 3-dominant individuals, in small groups, that they need to lean on each other to succeed. People evolve slowly from one stage to the next, so using later-stage techniques to motivate earlier-stage colleagues will land poorly."

# Motivation, Communication Patterns and Effectiveness

In [Tribal Leadership](https://www.amazon.com/Tribal-Leadership-Leveraging-Thriving-Organization/dp/0061251321) Logan *et. al.* describe five “stages” that people - and by extension the “tribes” they sort themselves into - go through: (1) *life is unfair*, might as well get mine; (2) *my life sucks*, I should just keep my head down and try not to be bothered, (3) *I’m awesome* but everyone around me is an idiot, (4) *We’re amazing* *but* that other team is awful - let’s beat them; and (5) *We’re amazing* and can change the world; a tribe dominated by people and the language of higher stages will outperform those from earlier ones. Leaders who can spot and react to these patterns can help their people and team grow their motivation and effectiveness. For example, small clusters of people in stage 2, my life sucks, can improve if they get a win and can identify as having ownership; while stage 3-dominant individuals need to be shown, in small triads, that they each have skills they exceed at and areas they need help. But people evolve slowly from one stage to the next - leaning into stage 5 language, “we’re amazing and have a great mission,” to folks in stage 2 or 3, will read as disingenuous and the natural cynicism of these stages will win out.
