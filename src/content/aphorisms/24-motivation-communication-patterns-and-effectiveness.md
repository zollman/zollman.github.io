[Tribal Leadership](https://www.amazon.com/Tribal-Leadership-Leveraging-Thriving-Organization/dp/0061251321)  describes five “stages” that people - and by extension the “tribes” they sort themselves into - go through: (1) *life is unfair*, might as well get mine; (2) *my life sucks*, I should just keep my head down and try not to be bothered, (3) *I’m awesome* but everyone around me is an idiot, (4) *We’re amazing but* that other team is awful - let’s beat them; and (5) *We’re amazing* and can change the world. Leaders who spot and use these patterns effectively create better, more motivated teams: for example, give small stage 2 clusters a win and watch them grow by having ownership. Show stage 3-dominant individuals, in small groups, that they need to lean on each other to succeed. People evolve slowly from one stage to the next, so using later-stage techniques to motivate earlier-stage colleagues will land poorly.
