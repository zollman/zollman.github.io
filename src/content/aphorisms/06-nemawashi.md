Literally “turning the roots” (preparing the roots of a bonsai tree for transplantation); in an organizational context it’s a perfect shorthand for shepherding complex decisions. Decisions often require complex tradeoffs and insight from different parts of the organization, so getting agreement goes best when you’ve done the prep work - going to each stakeholder in turn to get their feedback and input on a design or concept. By the time the proposal comes to a formal decision at an architecture board, budget committee or staff review, you’ve incorporated everyone else’s context and come closest to the best possible outcome.
