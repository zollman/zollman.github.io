description: "Literally “turning the roots” (preparing the roots of a bonsai tree for transplantation); in an organizational context it’s a perfect shorthand for shepherding complex decisions. Decisions often require complex tradeoffs and insight from different parts of the organization, so getting agreement goes best when you’ve done the prep work - going to each stakeholder in turn to get their feedback and input on a design or concept. By the time the proposal comes to a formal decision at an architecture board, budget committee or staff review, you’ve incorporated everyone else’s context and come closest to the best possible outcome."

# Nemawashi

Although it literally means “turning the roots” - preparing a bonsai tree for transplantation by carefully preparing the roots and soil, in an organizational context it’s a perfect shorthand for shepherding along complex decisions. Since decisions are rarely made in a vacuum, and often require complex tradeoffs and context, forcing a decision with a large group of stakeholders works best when you’ve done the prep work - going to each stakeholder in turn to get their feedback and input on a proposal, design or concept. By the time you bring the proposal to a formal decision - architecture board, budget committee or staff review - you’ve incorporated everyone else’s context and come closest to the best possible outcome.
