When asked an open-ended question or recommending a change, it‚Äôs helpful to respond with ‚Äúwhy, then what, then how‚Äù - a shared *why*, a business goal that everyone in the organization agrees on; then a specific what - deliverable or action that is one way to partially achieve that goal; and then an optional how - processes and specific steps that will produce the what you‚Äôve committed to. That helps anchor the conversation and makes it easier to figure out where you may disagree - on the goals (where you really shouldn‚Äôt disagree), on what you plan to deliver to attack the goal (where you can have a reasonable debate, and where others will rely on what you produce), or on tactics (that may not matter and can change without involving others)."

# Why, then what, then how

Groups larger than a single team suffer from context breaks: people are naturally focused on their local priorities and processes. When asked an open-ended question or recommending a change, it‚Äôs helpful to respond with ‚Äúwhy, then what, then how‚Äù - a shared *why*, a business goal that everyone in the organization agrees on; then a specific what - deliverable or action that is one way to partially achieve that goal; and then an optional how - processes and specific steps that will produce the what you‚Äôve committed to. That helps anchor the conversation and makes it easier to figure out where you may disagree - on the goals (where you really shouldn‚Äôt disagree), on what you plan to deliver to attack the goal (where you can have a reasonable debate, and where others will rely on what you produce), or on tactics (that may not matter and can change without involving others).
