description: "Originating in a structured practice of connecting to customer needs in enterprise sales,  “P2V2C” helps triage *any* stakeholder’s needs, including within organizations. Try to understand these five things: (a) *Pain*: what is your counterpart experiencing today that must get fixed? Without immediate pain, your needs won't make their priority list. (b) *Power*: who has authority to make the decision? Are you talking directly to a decisionmaker? (c) *Vision*: are you both moving in the same direction? (d) *Value*: How do *they* define success, or (to be crass), how will this show up in their performance review? (e) *Control*: How will you work together? Implementation is easier if you share tools, cultures or practices. With limited time for discovery with a partner, prioritize understanding these topics and tailor your approach to address them."

# Pain, Power, Vision, Value, Control

Originating in “Solution Selling” - the practice of connecting to customer needs in a sales process - “P2V2C” is a helpful practice for understanding *any* stakeholder’s needs, including within organizations, where you need to negotiate and partner to get things done. The five things you need to understand are: (a) Pain: what is your counterpart experiencing today that must get fixed? If they don’t have an active pain you can connect to, they’re less likely to take the time to work. (b) Power: who has the authority to make the decision you want - and if you’re not talking to them, how can you get to them? (c) Vision: long-term, are you and your counterpart moving in the same direction? (d) Value: How do *they* define success, or, in crass terms, will this help their budget or at least show up in their performance reviews and OKRS? (e) Control: How will you work together? Implementation is much easier if you share tools, cultures or practices. If you have limited time for discovery and discussion with a partner, prioritize understanding these topics - and tailoring your approach to address them.
