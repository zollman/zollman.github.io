description: "Originating in “Solution Selling” - the practice of connecting to customer needs in a sales process - “P2V2C” is a helpful practice for understanding *any* stakeholder’s needs, including within organizations, where you need to negotiate and partner to get things done. The five things you need to understand are: (a) Pain: what is your counterpart experiencing today that must get fixed? If they don’t have an active pain you can connect to, they’re less likely to take the time to work. (b) Power: who has the authority to make the decision you want - and if you’re not talking to them, how can you get to them? (c) Vision: long-term, are you and your counterpart moving in the same direction? (d) Value: How do *they* define success, or, in crass terms, will this help their budget or at least show up in their performance reviews and OKRS? (e) Control: How will you work together? Implementation is much easier if you share tools, cultures or practices. If you have limited time for discovery and discussion with a partner, prioritize understanding these topics - and tailoring your approach to address them."
