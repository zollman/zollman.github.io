Originating in a structured practice of connecting to customer needs in enterprise sales, “P2V2C” helps triage *any* stakeholder’s needs, including within organizations. Try to understand these five things: (a) *Pain*: what is your counterpart experiencing today that must get fixed? Without immediate pain, your needs won't make their priority list. (b) *Power*: who has authority to make the decision? Are you talking directly to a decisionmaker? (c) *Vision*: are you both moving in the same direction? (d) *Value*: How do they define success, or (to be crass), how will this show up in their performance review? (e) *Control*: How will you work together? Implementation is easier if you share tools, cultures or practices. With limited time for discovery with a partner, prioritize understanding these topics and tailor your approach to address them.
