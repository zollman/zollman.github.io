# Why, then what, then how

Context in organizations is hard: people know their local priorities and processes, but can't connect them to the whole. A good format for organizing answers is ‚Äúwhy, then what, then how‚Äù - a shared *why*, a business goal that everyone in the organization agrees on; then a specific *what* - deliverable or action that is one path toward that goal; and then an optional how - specific processes to deliver what you‚Äôve committed to. ‚ÄúWhy, what, how‚Äù anchors the conversation and highlights where you may disagree: Do you have different goals, priorities or tactics? Do your disagreements matter?
