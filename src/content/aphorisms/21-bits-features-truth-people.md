Teams that ship software are built on top of four core knowledge areas: (1) what the technology is capable of and translating ideas into product; (2) what users will adopt; (3) how to get things done and stay on schedule; (4) what the people on the team need, and how to support them. These four areas may have natural titles - senior engineer (or tech lead), product manager, technical program manager and engineering manager - Rands introduced the framing of ‚Äúbits, features, and truth‚Äù to highlight that it‚Äôs not *titles* that matter - it‚Äôs the skills themselves. When constructing a team, you want to know who has accountability for each area. But when thinking of your own career, aim for baseline ability in all four. Great engineers who also advocate for users and get things done? Product managers who own execution? These are massively valuable and minimize communication friction.
