description: "Teams that ship software are built on top of four core knowledge areas: (1) what the technology is capable of and ability to translate ideas into product; (2) what users need and will adopt; (3) how to get things done and keep everyone on schedule; (4) what the people on the team need, and how to support them. While these four areas may have natural titles - senior engineer (or tech lead), product manager, technical program manager and engineering manager - Rands introduced the framing of ‚Äúbits, features, and truth‚Äù to highlight that it‚Äôs not *titles* that matter - it‚Äôs the skills themselves. When constructing a team, you want to know what these four areas are, and who has accountability for each. But when thinking of your own career, it‚Äôs good to have baseline ability in all four - after all, a great engineer who can also advocate for users and get things done? A product manager who can drive execution? These can be massively valuable to minimize communication friction on a team."
