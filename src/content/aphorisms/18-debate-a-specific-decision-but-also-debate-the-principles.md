description: "If you‚Äôre trying to argue for a specific outcome and you find the conversation going in circles, step back: what kind of decision are we making - design, budget, priority? - and what general framework is best - cost, risk, short-term and long-term value - for evaluating options? Or, if you find yourself stuck on a general-purpose framework, stress-test with real examples and edge cases: would *this project* fall above your cutline? We may have clear policies and timelines for promotions - but do they work when someone is exceptional and at-risk? A focus only on single decisions or frameworks alone will be inadequate, with an untested framework muddling decisions; or each individual case devolving into independent, from-first-principles debates."

# Debate a specific decision, but also debate the principles

If you‚Äôre trying to argue for a specific outcome and you find the conversation going in circles, go up a level: what kind of decision are we making - design, budget, priority? - and what general framework is best - cost, risk, short-term and long-term value - for evaluating options? Alternately, if you find yourself stuck trying to create a general-purpose framework, stress-test your decisions with real examples and edge cases: would this project fall above or below your cutline? We may have clear policies and timelines for promotions - but if someone is exceptional and at-risk, who thinks those policies are inadequate? A focus only on one or the other will be inadequate, with a framework that‚Äôs designed to help with decisions only serving to muddle them; or each individual case devolving into independent, from-first-principles debates.
