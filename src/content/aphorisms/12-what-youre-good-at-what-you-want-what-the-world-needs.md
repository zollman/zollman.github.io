No job is perfect. When helping a friend or teammate with professional development, or considering options for your own next role, start with three separate questions: (a) What are you *good at?* Managers will expect you to have some of the relevant skills already - so be honest with yourself about your unique strengths and how youâ€™ll show them off. (b) What do you *want?* Frame it in terms of outcomes or rewards - learning, growth, impact, compensation - than artifacts of status like level or title. (c) What does *the world need?* A job has to provide value, or itâ€™s just a hobby. Any role will be a balance of these: not perfectly suited to your strengths, or everything you want for yourself, and plentiful in the market, but neither should you compromise entirely on one area, either.
