# What you’re good at, what you want, what the world needs

No job is perfect. When helping a friend or teammate think through questions of professional development, or considering options for your own next role - it can be helpful to decompose the problem into three separate questions: (a) What are you *good at?* You should expect that people will generally want to hire you into jobs where you have at least some of the relevant skills already - so it helps to be honest with yourself about your unique strengths and how you’ll take about them. (b) What do you *want?* Better to frame it in terms of outcomes or rewards - learning, growth, impact, compensation - than artifacts of status like level or title; but if status matters that’s important to know. (c) What does the world need? A job has to provide value to someone, or it’s just a hobby. Any role will be a balance of these: not perfectly suited to your strengths, or everything you want for yourself, and plentiful in the market, but neither should you compromise entirely on one area, either.
