Proposals are easier to understand in context. If your recommendation is to “do something” and the primary alternative presented is “don’t do that thing,” inertia can win out; you're asking your reader to understand the consequences of the alternatives. But too much choice and context leads to [bikeshedding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality) and conversations that drag without a decision. Boil complex decisions down to three options: maybe from most to least expensive; or highest to lowest risk; define an Option A, B and C, with real tradeoffs - *and make a recommendation*. The feedback you get will help you understand business context and keep everyone aligned as you build.
