# Let’s see Option A, B, and C (I recommend option B)

It’s much easier to evaluate a proposal in context. Leaders see a lot of proposals to “do something” where the primary alternative presented is “don’t do that thing.” Inertia can win out, because the full consequences of the alternatives aren’t clear. But presenting too many choices - lots of knobs and dials to adjust scope - leads to [bikeshedding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality) and conversations that drag without a decision. You can achieve the best balance by boiling down a complex decision to three options: maybe from most to least expensive; maybe from highest to lowest risk - define an Option A, B and C, with real business tradeoffs - *and make a recommendation*. The feedback you get will help you understand business context and put you in the best place to stay aligned as you build.
