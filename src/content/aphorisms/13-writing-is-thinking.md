Processes that feel like empty paperwork - design reviews, job requisition forms - were often initially designed to encourage completeness of thinking, ensuring that you considered the most critical considerations in your proposal. Even if there’s no process forcing you to write, it’s still an important exercise: can you make your idea precise, clear, relevant to multiple audiences; and fit all the parts into a coherent whole and compelling flow?"

# Writing is thinking

Ideas always seem clear in your head, but the process of distilling them - laying down an argument or plan - forces you to fill in the details and separate out the important from unimportant. Processes that feel like empty paperwork - design reviews, job requisition forms - were often initially designed to encourage completeness of thinking, ensuring that you considered the most critical considerations in your proposal. Even if there’s no process forcing you to write, it’s still an important exercise: can you make your idea precise, clear, relevant to multiple audiences; and fit all the parts into a coherent whole and compelling flow?
