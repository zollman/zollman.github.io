Pro-feedback cultures have high safety, low effort and clear benefit: (a) *High Safety* - people must believe that they won‚Äôt be yelled at, dismissed or worked around because they spoke up; (b) *Low Effort* - feedback should be solicited and shouldn't require perfect tone, phrasing or process. (c) *Clear Benefit* - feedback must result in change; asking for feedback without taking action will stop your peers from taking the time."

# High safety, low effort, clear benefit

Feedback takes work to prepare & deliver, so if you want people to give you feedback - and you should - it‚Äôs up to you to create the conditions that support it. Those conditions are: (a) High Safety - people must believe that they won‚Äôt be yelled at, dismissed or cut out of future conversations because of the feedback they gave; (b) Low Effort - there should be low barriers to feedback; you shouldn‚Äôt require someone to phrase everything perfectly or conform to a specific process; even better is if you ask, repeatedly and 1:1 for feedback. (c) Clear Benefit - people have to believe their feedback will result in change - asking for feedback and then never taking action will lead people to stop taking the time.
