Feedback takes work to prepare & deliver. If you want feedback - and you should - create a culture that supports it. Pro-feedback cultures have high safety, low effort and clear benefit: (a) *High Safety* - people must believe that they won‚Äôt be yelled at, dismissed or worked around because they spoke up; (b) *Low Effort* - feedback should be solicited and shouldn't require perfect tone, phrasing or process. (c) *Clear Benefit* - feedback must result in change; asking for feedback without taking action will stop your peers from taking the time.
