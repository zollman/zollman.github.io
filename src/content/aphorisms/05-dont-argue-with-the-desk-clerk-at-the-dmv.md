description: "Bureaucracies create disempowered people, who have a narrow view of the world and little interest in the bigger problems their role fits into. Maybe it’s an overly risk-averse HR rep, a procurement associate or vendor security analyst: these processes need to exist in large companies, but the individuals implementing them aren’t often able to make their own tradeoffs. If you get an unfavorable decision from a disempowered partner, you can either try helping empower them - or accept that you should’ve found someone else in the hierarchy to partner with instead."

# Don’t argue with the desk clerk at the DMV

Bureaucracies create disempowered people, who have a narrow view of the world and little interest in the bigger problems their role fits into. Maybe it’s an overly risk-averse HR rep, a procurement associate or vendor security analyst: these processes need to exist in large companies, but the individuals implementing them aren’t often able to make their own tradeoffs. If you get an unfavorable decision from a disempowered partner, you can either try helping empower them - or accept that you should’ve found someone else in the hierarchy to partner with instead.
