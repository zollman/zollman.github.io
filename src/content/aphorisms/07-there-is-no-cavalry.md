“We should” - “I don’t understand why we don’t” - “It would be great if...” these are common things to hear, but they rarely lead to action. That’s because there’s no “secret we” - everyone already has their own projects. When proposing a project, who do you think should do it? What skills and personas are needed to get the job done? What would it take to get them interested and committed to the idea? There is no cavalry coming: how are you going to rally the troops yourself?
