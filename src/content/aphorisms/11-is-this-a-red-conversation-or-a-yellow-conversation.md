Do you *need* help or *want* help? Management involves a lot of problem triage, and it can be difficult to distinguish between an advisory conversation - “I have this under control and I don’t need action today, but in case you have good advice for me...” - and an escalation - “I don’t think we’re going to make this timeline / budget / deliverable work without help.” So be explicit: flag upfront whether this is a yellow (advisory) conversation, then explain what you’re trying and how you’ll know if it worked; or state directly that it’s a red (escalation) conversation, talking through what you’ve tried, what you’re asking for, and what happens if help doesn't arrive. Colleagues want to help - but you have to make clear that you’re asking.
