description: "One of the first things you learn in flight training is *positive control*. Only one person can fly the airplane at a time; if the student and instructor are fighting each other, bad things happen. So you practice a three-way handoff: “I’m giving you the flight controls.” “I have the flight controls.” “You have the flight controls.” That way it’s never in doubt who is making the decisions and who is on the yoke. The same level of explicit handoffs can be helpful in project management and delegation - if it’s unclear, ask: who has the flight controls? I’ve completed a part of the project, are you good to take it from here?"

# Who has the flight controls?

One of the first things you learn in flight training is *positive control*. Only one person can fly the airplane at a time; if the student and instructor are fighting each other, bad things happen. So you practice a three-way handoff: “I’m giving you the flight controls.” “I have the flight controls.” “You have the flight controls.” That way it’s never in doubt who is making the decisions and whose hands are on the yoke. The same level of explicit handoff is helpful in project management and delegation - if it’s unclear, ask: who has the flight controls? I’ve completed a part of the project, are you good to take it from here?
