# The Janitor and the Ivory Tower

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll have a development team and an ops team,‚Äù engineering orgs used to say, before Flickr taught us about DevOps in 2009; and while infrastructure and product engineering are still separate disciplines, the core insight from that talk remains true. If you design your org such that one team gets to do the exciting work with shiny toys and greenfield exploration, while another team does the maintenance and support, burdened by legacy baggage handed to them by the innovators, *you serve neither team well*. Not the janitors - who burn out and miss opportunities to grow, without feeling ownership of what they build; but also *not the ivory tower team* - who, by being disconnected from the real-world consequences of what they build, are liable to miss important details. When designing organizations, try to avoid creating a janitor team and an ivory tower one.
