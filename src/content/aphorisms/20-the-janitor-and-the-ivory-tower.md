‚ÄúWe‚Äôll have a development team and an ops team,‚Äù engineering used to say, before Flickr taught us about DevOps. Infrastructure and product engineering are still separate disciplines, but the core insight remains true. If your org design has one team that gets to do the exciting work with shiny toys and greenfield exploration, while another team does maintenance and support, burdened by legacy baggage handed to them by the innovators, *you serve neither team well*. Not the *janitors* - who burn out and miss opportunities to grow, without feeling ownership of what they build; but also not the *ivory tower* team - who, by being disconnected from the real-world consequences of what they build, are liable to miss important details.
