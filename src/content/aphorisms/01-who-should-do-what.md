Being specific matters: are you looking for a change in priority, a different SLA, a completely different workflow? Who is empowered and capable of making that change? Starting with that question forces you to take ownership of the analysis and move from vague complaints to actionable recommendations."

# Who Should Do What Differently (Be Specific)

Problems may be cultural or systemic, but change happens one person at a time. When proposing a change, stop to ask yourself what, specifically, someone should stop doing - or what specific thing you want produced that doesn't exist today. Being specific matters: are you looking for a change in priority, a different SLA, a completely different workflow? Who is empowered and capable of making that change? Starting with that question forces you to take ownership of the analysis and move from vague complaints to actionable recommendations.
