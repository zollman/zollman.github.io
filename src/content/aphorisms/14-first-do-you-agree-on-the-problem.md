# First, do you agree on the problem?

Knowledge work is a lot of convincing others to do things, and getting frustrated when they don‚Äôt happen the way you‚Äôd hoped. Before getting too upset, or diving into details of plan or delivery, it‚Äôs best to figure out where you‚Äôre misaligned. Whether you‚Äôre trying to align with a peer, diagnose a problem, or work through performance management questions, it‚Äôs helpful to work with your counterpart through five steps: (1) Do they agree there‚Äôs a problem (and on the problem definition)? (2) Do they agree it‚Äôs *their* problem to solve (or do they believe it‚Äôs someone else‚Äôs)? (3) Do they *want to solve the problem now* (or do they think something else is a higher priority)? (4) Can they *develop a plan* to solve the problem? (5) Can they *follow through in executing the plan?* It‚Äôs important to take these steps in order: providing a plan and micromanaging followups is bound to fail if steps 1-3 aren‚Äôt completed; and knowing where the problem is helps you fix it together.
