# First, do you agree on the problem?

Knowledge work is a lot of convincing others to do things, and getting frustrated when they don’t happen the way you’d hoped. Before getting too upset, or diving into details of plan or delivery, it’s best to figure out where you’re misaligned. Whether you’re trying to align with a peer, diagnose a problem, or work through performance management questions, it’s helpful to work with your counterpart through five steps: (1) Do they agree there’s a problem (and on the problem definition)? (2) Do they agree it’s *their* problem to solve (or do they believe it’s someone else’s)? (3) Do they *want to solve the problem now* (or do they think something else is a higher priority)? (4) Can they *develop a plan* to solve the problem? (5) Can they *follow through in executing the plan?* It’s important to take these steps in order: providing a plan and micromanaging followups is bound to fail if steps 1-3 aren’t completed; and knowing where the problem is helps you fix it together.
