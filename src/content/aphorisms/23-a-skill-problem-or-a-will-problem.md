description: "If something isn’t getting done in the way you expect, before blaming laziness or stupidity, it’s best to assume there’s a reasonable, and fixable, explanation. When thinking through the blockers, it can be helpful to break down the reasons into “skill” or “will” (even though it’s often a combination of both): “Will” - the person doesn’t *want* to do the work - can be addressed by changing prioritization, giving better motivation or context. “Skill” - the person wants to do the work, but is missing some core ability - can be addressed through pairing, formal learning and development, breaking down the task into smaller units or changing the structure of the work entirely. Either way, picturing in your head an x/y graph - skill vs. will - and plotting a path from where your partner is to where they need to be will help you get them there."

# A Skill problem or a Will problem

If something isn’t getting done in the way you expect, before blaming laziness or stupidity, it’s best to assume there’s a reasonable, and fixable, explanation. When thinking through the blockers, it can be helpful to break down the reasons into “skill” or “will” (even though it’s often a combination of both): “Will” - the person doesn’t *want* to do the work - can be addressed by changing prioritization, giving better motivation or context. “Skill” - the person wants to do the work, but is missing some core ability - can be addressed through pairing, formal learning and development, breaking down the task into smaller units or changing the structure of the work entirely. Either way, picturing in your head an x/y graph - skill vs. will - and plotting a path from where your partner is to where they need to be will help you get them there.
