We all hope for major-league glory and the rewards that come with it. But few of us go straight from the draft to the all-star game. Most careers grow bit-by-bit and choice-by-choice: work for an established player but a narrower role - or take a gamble on a smaller company with more autonomy but more risk of failure. There’s no perfect answer; at some points in your career it’s helpful to learn from an organization and colleagues who’ve already won a ring (or built a successful business); in others, it’s better just to get more at-bats (and learn more of the business) while relying on your own skills to grow. Either way, be clear on the decision you’re making - and never compromise on quality teammates for the sake of a bullet on a resume.
