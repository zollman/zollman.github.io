# Start for the Blue Jays or ride the bench for the Yankees?

We all hope for major-league glory and the recognition and reward that comes with it. But few of us will go straight from the draft to the all-star game. Most careers grow bit by bit, and you will be faced with a choice: work for an established player in a narrower role - or take a gamble on a smaller company with more autonomy but more risk of failure. There‚Äôs no perfect answer; at some points in your career it‚Äôs helpful to learn from the organization, colleagues and practices alongside teammates who‚Äôve already won a ring (or built a successful business); in others, it‚Äôs better just to get more at-bats (and learn more of the business) while relying on your own skills to grow. Either way, be clear on the decision you‚Äôre making - and never compromise on quality teammates for the sake of a bullet on a resume.
