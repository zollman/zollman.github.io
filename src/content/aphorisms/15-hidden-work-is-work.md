# Hidden work is work

The “build” part of a project, when the code is being written or the building constructed, is the most visible. But for that part to be successful there’s a huge amount of hidden work to account for. Before build starts is a process of getting clarity on what to build, iterating through designs or proof-of-concept technologies, and marshalling resources. After build completes there is validation, delivery, client follow-through, and ongoing maintenance. Teams that don’t plan for the hidden work, and whose schedules only account for the cost of the build, will struggle: they will feel behind, miss deadlines, and compromise on quality. Each project’s needs for prep and follow-through will be different, so make sure they are accounted for in your team’s planning and delivery processes.
