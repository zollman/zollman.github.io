The “build” part of a project, when the code is being written or the building constructed, is the most visible. But below that visible success is a great deal of hidden work. Before build starts, there is creating clarity on what to build, iterating on designs or proofs-of-concept, and marshalling resources. After build completes there is validation, delivery, client follow-through, and ongoing maintenance. Teams that don’t plan for the hidden work will struggle: they will feel behind, miss deadlines, and compromise on quality. Each project’s needs for prep and follow-through will be different, so make sure they are accounted for in your team’s planning and delivery processes.
