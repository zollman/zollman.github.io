# Platforms and Products; Interfaces, Consulting and Collaboration

The most unsolvable problem in org design is when to use a ‚Äúmission-aligned‚Äù design - independent organizations with their own P\&L and distinct business problems (GMs overseeing products or territories) who may need to replicate common skills; vs. ‚Äúfunction-aligned‚Äù organizations who have depth in a skill area - data science, engineering, sales. Mission-aligned teams can move faster, thanks to independence; but it‚Äôs harder for them to staff a critical mass of functional experts - and they can duplicate work within a company. Function-aligned teams can go deeper and be more efficient in their areas of expertise and resourcing, but create mission bottlenecks that require complex coordination. To balance these, you have to explicitly design the interfaces between teams. [Team Topologies](https://teamtopologies.com/key-concepts) provides a good framework: where do you define hard boundaries that operate over X-as-a-service interfaces; where do you facilitate other teams‚Äô work with a drop-in, consulting model; and where do you bring disparate teams together for a defined period of time to build something requiring deep collaboration?
