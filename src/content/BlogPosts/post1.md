# The Discovery of Radium

The discovery of radium marked a significant milestone in the field of radioactivity research.

## The Research Process

In 1898, my husband Pierre and I discovered the element radium. This discovery was the result of years of research and experimentation. Radium is a highly radioactive element with remarkable properties...

### Key Findings

- Radium is highly radioactive
- It produces luminescence
- It has potential medical applications

## Experimental Methods

Our research involved:

1. Processing uraninite ore
2. Chemical separation techniques
3. Precise measurements of radioactivity

### Technical Challenges

> The processing of pitchblende was a particularly challenging task, requiring tons of raw material to obtain mere decigrams of radium.

Some code we used for calculations:
`E = mc²`
