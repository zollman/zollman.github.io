### Who Should Do What Differently (Be Specific) {#who-should-do-what-differently-(be-specific)}

Problems may be cultural or systemic, but change happens one person at a time. When proposing a change, stop to ask yourself what, specifically, someone should stop doing \- or what specific thing you want produced that doesn’t exist today. Being specific matters: are you looking for a change in priority, a different SLA, a completely different workflow? Who is empowered and capable of making that change? Starting with that question forces you to take ownership of the analysis and move from vague complaints to actionable recommendations.

### Why, then what, then how {#why,-then-what,-then-how}

Groups larger than a single team suffer from context breaks: people are naturally focused on their local priorities and processes. When asked an open-ended question or recommending a change, it’s helpful to respond with “why, then what, then how” \- a shared *why*, a business goal that everyone in the organization agrees on; then a specific what \- deliverable or action that is one way to partially achieve that goal; and then an optional how \- processes and specific steps that will produce the what you’ve committed to. That helps anchor the conversation and makes it easier to figure out where you may disagree \- on the goals (where you really shouldn’t disagree), on what you plan to deliver to attack the goal (where you can have a reasonable debate, and where others will rely on what you produce), or on tactics (that may not matter and can change without involving others).

### High safety, low effort, clear benefit {#high-safety,-low-effort,-clear-benefit}

Feedback takes work to prepare & deliver, so if you want people to give you feedback \- and you should \- it’s up to you to create the conditions that support it. Those conditions are: (a) High Safety \- people must believe that they won’t be yelled at, dismissed or cut out of future conversations because of the feedback they gave; (b) Low Effort \- there should be low barriers to feedback; you shouldn’t require someone to phrase everything perfectly or conform to a specific process; even better is if you ask, repeatedly and 1:1 for feedback. (c) Clear Benefit \- people have to believe their feedback will result in change \- asking for feedback and then never taking action will lead people to stop taking the time.

### Call your shot, take your shot, celebrate your shot {#call-your-shot,-take-your-shot,-celebrate-your-shot}

Most of what we work on is complex enough that it’s hard to judge the quality from a quick glance. So for bigger projects, it’s important to build trust through time \- and the best way to do that is to consistently say what you’re going to do \- then do it. Call your shot: using “why, what and how” language, describe the project you’re about to undertake and why it solves a problem. Take your shot: do what you said, making adjustments \- especially to the “how” \- as necessary. Then celebrate your shot: show off what you did, and connect back to the problem it was supposed to solve. This last part is important \- no one will pay as much attention to your work as you, but everyone loves to celebrate when something goes well.

### Don’t argue with the desk clerk at the DMV {#don’t-argue-with-the-desk-clerk-at-the-dmv}

Bureaucracies create disempowered people, who have a narrow view of the world and little interest in the bigger problems their role fits into. Maybe it’s an overly risk-averse HR rep, a procurement associate or vendor security analyst: these processes need to exist in large companies, but the individuals implementing them aren’t often able to make their own tradeoffs. If you get an unfavorable decision from a disempowered partner, you can either try helping empower them \- or accept that you should’ve found someone else in the hierarchy to partner with instead.

### Nemawashi {#nemawashi}

Although it literally means “turning the roots” \- preparing a bonsai tree for transplantation by carefully preparing the roots and soil, in an organizational context it’s a perfect shorthand for shepherding along complex decisions. Since decisions are rarely made in a vacuum, and often require complex tradeoffs and context, forcing a decision with a large group of stakeholders works best when you’ve done the prep work \- going to each stakeholder in turn to get their feedback and input on a proposal, design or concept. By the time you bring the proposal to a formal decision \- architecture board, budget committee or staff review \- you’ve incorporated everyone else’s context and come closest to the best possible outcome.

### There is no cavalry {#there-is-no-cavalry}

“We should” \- “I don’t understand why we don’t” \- “It would be great if”... these are common things to hear, but they rarely lead to action. That’s because there’s no “secret we” \- everyone already has their own projects. When proposing a project, who do you think should do it? What skills and personas are needed to get the job done? What would it take to get them interested and committed to the idea? There is no cavalry coming: how are you going to rally the troops yourself?

### First you must try, and then you must ask {#first-you-must-try,-and-then-you-must-ask}

Trying is learning. Especially if you’re a novice at a topic, working with more experienced practitioners. If you’re stuck on finding a bug, figuring out a phrase, generating a new insight, getting a tool to work \- push yourself past the point of being stuck. Take another 15 minutes to brainstorm ideas, come up with tests, search for related documentation, and give it another shot. Then, when you’ve done that, write down what you tried and go ask for help. This has three great outcomes: First, you’re likely to learn new techniques. Second, you can blaze a path for the next person stuck on a similar problem. And third, the expert is in a better position to help you \- because they can see what you tried, and provide more targeted advice. Don’t stay stuck forever \- people love to help. But try, and then ask.

### Let’s see Option A, B, and C (I recommend option B) {#let’s-see-option-a,-b,-and-c-(i-recommend-option-b)}

It’s much easier to evaluate a proposal in context. Leaders see a lot of proposals to “do something” where the primary alternative presented is “don’t do that thing.” Inertia can win out, because the full consequences of the alternatives aren’t clear. But presenting too many choices \- lots of knobs and dials to adjust scope \- leads to [bikeshedding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality) and conversations that drag without a decision. You can achieve the best balance by boiling down a complex decision to three options: maybe from most to least expensive; maybe from highest to lowest risk \- define an Option A, B and C, with real business tradeoffs \- *and make a recommendation*. The feedback you get will help you understand business context and put you in the best place to stay aligned as you build.

### Pain, Power, Vision, Value, Control {#pain,-power,-vision,-value,-control}

Originating in “Solution Selling” \- the practice of connecting to customer needs in a sales process \- “P2V2C” is a helpful practice for understanding *any* stakeholder’s needs, including within organizations, where you need to negotiate and partner to get things done. The five things you need to understand are: (a) Pain: what is your counterpart experiencing today that must get fixed? If they don’t have an active pain you can connect to, they’re less likely to take the time to work. (b) Power: who has the authority to make the decision you want \- and if you’re not talking to them, how can you get to them? (c) Vision: long-term, are you and your counterpart moving in the same direction? (d) Value: How do *they* define success, or, in crass terms, will this help their budget or at least show up in their performance reviews and OKRS? (e) Control: How will you work together? Implementation is much easier if you share tools, cultures or practices. If you have limited time for discovery and discussion with a partner, prioritize understanding these topics \- and tailoring your approach to address them.

### Is this a “red” conversation or a “yellow” conversation? {#is-this-a-“red”-conversation-or-a-“yellow”-conversation?}

Do you *need* help or *want* help? Managers spend a lot of time listening to reports on where there are problems, and it can be difficult to distinguish between an advisory conversation \- “I have this under control, I don’t need you to take action, but in case you have good advice for me here’s what’s going on” \- and an escalation \- “I don’t think we’re going to make this timeline / budget / deliverable work without some external help.” Given that it’s helpful to be explicit: flag upfront whether this is a yellow (advisory) conversation and explain what you’re trying and how you’ll know if you’ve solved the problem; or state directly that it’s a red (escalation) conversation and be prepared to talk through what you’ve tried, what you’re asking for, and what happens if you aren’t able to solve it on your own. Managers (and peers) want to help \- but you have to make clear that you’re asking.

### What you’re good at, what you want, what the world needs {#what-you’re-good-at,-what-you-want,-what-the-world-needs}

No job is perfect. When helping a friend or teammate think through questions of professional development, or considering options for your own next role \- it can be helpful to decompose the problem into three separate questions: (a) What are you *good at?* You should expect that people will generally want to hire you into jobs where you have at least some of the relevant skills already \- so it helps to be honest with yourself about your unique strengths and how you’ll take about them. (b) What do you *want?* Better to frame it in terms of outcomes or rewards \- learning, growth, impact, compensation \- than artifacts of status like level or title; but if status matters that’s important to know. (c) What does the world need? A job has to provide value to someone, or it’s just a hobby. Any role will be a balance of these: not perfectly suited to your strengths, or everything you want for yourself, and plentiful in the market, but neither should you compromise entirely on one area, either.

### Writing is thinking {#writing-is-thinking}

Ideas always seem clear in your head, but the process of distilling them \- laying down an argument or plan \- forces you to fill in the details and separate out the important from unimportant. Processes that feel like empty paperwork \- design reviews, job requisition forms \- were often initially designed to encourage completeness of thinking, ensuring that you considered the most critical considerations in your proposal. Even if there’s no process forcing you to write, it’s still an important exercise: can you make your idea precise, clear, relevant to multiple audiences; and fit all the parts into a coherent whole and compelling flow?

### First, do you agree on the problem? {#first,-do-you-agree-on-the-problem?}

Knowledge work is a lot of convincing others to do things, and getting frustrated when they don’t happen the way you’d hoped. Before getting too upset, or diving into details of plan or delivery, it’s best to figure out where you’re misaligned. Whether you’re trying to align with a peer, diagnose a problem, or work through performance management questions, it’s helpful to work with your counterpart through five steps: (1) Do they agree there’s a problem (and on the problem definition)? (2) Do they agree it’s *their* problem to solve (or do they believe it’s someone else’s)? (3) Do they *want to solve the problem now* (or do they think something else is a higher priority)? (4) Can they *develop a plan* to solve the problem? (5) Can they *follow through in executing the plan?* It’s important to take these steps in order: providing a plan and micromanaging followups is bound to fail if steps 1-3 aren’t completed; and knowing where the problem is helps you fix it together.

### Hidden work is work {#hidden-work-is-work}

The “build” part of a project, when the code is being written or the building constructed, is the most visible. But for that part to be successful there’s a huge amount of hidden work to account for. Before build starts is a process of getting clarity on what to build, iterating through designs or proof-of-concept technologies, and marshalling resources. After build completes there is validation, delivery, client follow-through, and ongoing maintenance. Teams that don’t plan for the hidden work, and whose schedules only account for the cost of the build, will struggle: they will feel behind, miss deadlines, and compromise on quality. Each project’s needs for prep and follow-through will be different, so make sure they are accounted for in your team’s planning and delivery processes.

### Start for the Blue Jays or ride the bench for the Yankees? {#start-for-the-blue-jays-or-ride-the-bench-for-the-yankees?}

We all hope for major-league glory and the recognition and reward that comes with it. But few of us will go straight from the draft to the all-star game. Most careers grow bit by bit, and you will be faced with a choice: work for an established player in a narrower role \- or take a gamble on a smaller company with more autonomy but more risk of failure. There’s no perfect answer; at some points in your career it’s helpful to learn from the organization, colleagues and practices alongside teammates who’ve already won a ring (or built a successful business); in others, it’s better just to get more at-bats (and learn more of the business) while relying on your own skills to grow. Either way, be clear on the decision you’re making \- and never compromise on quality teammates for the sake of a bullet on a resume.

### Who has the flight controls? {#who-has-the-flight-controls?}

One of the first things you learn in flight training is *positive control*. Only one person can fly the airplane at a time; if the student and instructor are fighting each other, bad things happen. So you practice a three-way handoff: “I’m giving you the flight controls.” “I have the flight controls.” “You have the flight controls.” That way it’s never in doubt who is making the decisions and who is on the yoke. The same level of explicit handoffs can be helpful in project management and delegation \- if it’s unclear, ask: who has the flight controls? I’ve completed a part of the project, are you good to take it from here?

### Debate a specific decision, but also debate the principles {#debate-a-specific-decision,-but-also-debate-the-principles}

If you’re trying to argue for a specific outcome and you find the conversation going in circles, go up a level: what kind of decision are we making \- design, budget, priority? \- and what general framework is best \- cost, risk, short-term and long-term value \- for evaluating options? Alternately, if you find yourself stuck trying to create a general-purpose framework, stress-test your decisions with real examples and edge cases: would this project fall above or below your cutline? We may have clear policies and timelines for promotions \- but if someone is exceptional and at-risk, who thinks those policies are inadequate? A focus only on one or the other will be inadequate, with a framework that’s designed to help with decisions only serving to muddle them; or each individual case devolving into independent, from-first-principles debates.

### Five bullets of five bullets {#five-bullets-of-five-bullets}

In 1956, George Miller wrote a paper on the thesis “the number of objects an average human can hold in working memory is 7, plus or minus 2.” Even this may be too high: we chunk phone numbers into groups of 4 and 3 to make them more memorable. When putting together an argument, proposal, or any structured process, it’s helpful to constrain your outline to “five bullets of five bullets” \- three to five top-line focus areas that best break down your project, each illustrated by three to five supporting components. If you find yourself with 20 interlocking arguments or an architecture with a dozen boxes, you may be adequately representing the complexity of a real-world problem \-- but you should still consider simplifying for the benefit of your audience.

### The Janitor and the Ivory Tower {#the-janitor-and-the-ivory-tower}

“We’ll have a development team and an ops team,” engineering orgs used to say, before Flickr taught us about DevOps in 2009; and while infrastructure and product engineering are still separate disciplines, the core insight from that talk remains true. If you design your org such that one team gets to do the exciting work with shiny toys and greenfield exploration, while another team does the maintenance and support, burdened by legacy baggage handed to them by the innovators, *you serve neither team well*. Not the janitors \- who burn out and miss opportunities to grow, without feeling ownership of what they build; but also *not the ivory tower team* \- who, by being disconnected from the real-world consequences of what they build, are liable to miss important details. When designing organizations, try to avoid creating a janitor team and an ivory tower one.

### Bits, Features, Truth, People {#bits,-features,-truth,-people}

Teams that ship software are built on top of four core knowledge areas: (1) what the technology is capable of and ability to translate ideas into product; (2) what users need and will adopt; (3) how to get things done and keep everyone on schedule; (4) what the people on the team need, and how to support them. While these four areas may have natural titles \- senior engineer (or tech lead), product manager, technical program manager and engineering manager \- Rands introduced the framing of “bits, features, and truth” to highlight that it’s not *titles* that matter \- it’s the skills themselves. When constructing a team, you want to know what these four areas are, and who has accountability for each. But when thinking of your own career, it’s good to have baseline ability in all four \- after all, a great engineer who can also advocate for users and get things done? A product manager who can drive execution? These can be massively valuable to minimize communication friction on a team.

### Demos are Hero Journeys {#demos-are-hero-journeys}

Show off your work\! Regularly demo’ing what you’ve built for others encourages you to keep the user’s concerns first and foremost, and helps avoid rabbit holes that are technically interesting but ultimately irrelevant. But don’t make people sit through a demo where you show off every feature and detail \- if you find yourself saying “and then you can just…”, stop: focus your talk track for a demo on *motivation* and *impact* instead of features and clicks. Even better: put your user on a [Hero’s Journey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero%27s_journey), the classic story template from mythology (and blockbuster films): our hero’s normal life has a problem, a sense of unease; sets off into new territory; learns from friends along the way; overcomes challenges; has a great success and returns home changed by the experience. A demo with a story that follows these beats will be more engaging and memorable than a simple walkthrough.

### A Skill problem or a Will problem {#a-skill-problem-or-a-will-problem}

If something isn’t getting done in the way you expect, before blaming laziness or stupidity, it’s best to assume there’s a reasonable, and fixable, explanation. When thinking through the blockers, it can be helpful to break down the reasons into “skill” or “will” (even though it’s often a combination of both): “Will” \- the person doesn’t *want* to do the work \- can be addressed by changing prioritization, giving better motivation or context. “Skill” \- the person wants to do the work, but is missing some core ability \- can be addressed through pairing, formal learning and development, breaking down the task into smaller units or changing the structure of the work entirely. Either way, picturing in your head an x/y graph \- skill vs. will \- and plotting a path from where your partner is to where they need to be will help you get them there.

### Motivation, Communication Patterns and Effectiveness {#motivation,-communication-patterns-and-effectiveness}

In [Tribal Leadership](https://www.amazon.com/Tribal-Leadership-Leveraging-Thriving-Organization/dp/0061251321) Logan *et. al.* describe five “stages” that people \- and by extension the “tribes” they sort themselves into \- go through: (1) *life is unfair*, might as well get mine; (2) *my life sucks*, I should just keep my head down and try not to be bothered, (3) *I’m awesome* but everyone around me is an idiot, (4) *We’re amazing* *but* that other team is awful \- let’s beat them; and (5) *We’re amazing* and can change the world; a tribe dominated by people and the language of higher stages will outperform those from earlier ones. Leaders who can spot and react to these patterns can help their people and team grow their motivation and effectiveness. For example, small clusters of people in stage 2, my life sucks, can improve if they get a win and can identify as having ownership; while stage 3-dominant individuals need to be shown, in small triads, that they each have skills they exceed at and areas they need help. But people evolve slowly from one stage to the next \- leaning into stage 5 language, “we’re amazing and have a great mission,” to folks in stage 2 or 3, will read as disingenuous and the natural cynicism of these stages will win out.

### Platforms and Products; Interfaces, Consulting and Collaboration {#platforms-and-products;-interfaces,-consulting-and-collaboration}

The most unsolvable problem in org design is when to use a “mission-aligned” design \- independent organizations with their own P\&L and distinct business problems (GMs overseeing products or territories) who may need to replicate common skills; vs. “function-aligned” organizations who have depth in a skill area \- data science, engineering, sales. Mission-aligned teams can move faster, thanks to independence; but it’s harder for them to staff a critical mass of functional experts \- and they can duplicate work within a company. Function-aligned teams can go deeper and be more efficient in their areas of expertise and resourcing, but create mission bottlenecks that require complex coordination. To balance these, you have to explicitly design the interfaces between teams. [Team Topologies](https://teamtopologies.com/key-concepts) provides a good framework: where do you define hard boundaries that operate over X-as-a-service interfaces; where do you facilitate other teams’ work with a drop-in, consulting model; and where do you bring disparate teams together for a defined period of time to build something requiring deep collaboration?

### To be of use {#to-be-of-use}

“The people I love the best / jump into work head first / without dallying in the shallows /  
and swim off with sure strokes almost out of sight…” So begins Marge Piercy’s poem, reminding us not to align ourselves with “parlor generals and field deserters, but move in a common rhythm when the food must go in or the fire be put out.” Strategy and teaching are important, but be skeptical of strategists and thought leaders, or “a strategy” as a consulting deliverable: if we are here to solve real problems, and help real people, we can’t disconnect ourselves from the hands-on work, whatever it is. Build something real: if you find yourself devoting quarters to a study, a platform development effort, or a rebuild, strongly consider whether you can find a “thin vertical slice” that delivers value \- and gets you feedback \- faster.
