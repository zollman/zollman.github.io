		<h1 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-8">Hi.</h1>
		
		<div class="prose prose-lg max-w-none">

            <p>
                I am a hands-on security and software engineering leader who has done tours in government, 
                startups, healthcare and global financial institutions. Coming up on 30 years in the industry,
                with tours in software engineering, data, and infrastructure, I've learned that humility, 
                curiosity about all the edges of a complex problem, and an understanding of how to Get Things
                Done are what you need to make amazing things happen.
            </p>

            <p>
                Things to talk to me about:
            </p>
						
			<ul>
				<li><b>Cloud security</b>, especially the evolving nature of cloud infrastructure, and how 
                    to simplify life for engineers building modern products.</li>
				<li><b>Compliance as code</b>, implementing technical guardrails for developers and end-users 
                    that enable them with freedom to explore, while creating transparency for regulators
                    and partners and managing risk effectively. I'm particularly interested in applications
                    of OpenPolicyAgent, eBPF and other policy / monitoring languages.
                </li>
				<li><b>Security applications of new tech</b>; of course that means AI (and especially 
                    MCP/A2A architectures), but I'm also excited
                    by WASM (and its ability to create clear component boundaries that run in different
                    sandboxes) and Rust (and other modern languages).
                </li>
				<li><b>The security and enterprise startup ecosystem</b>, especially teams solving 
                    problems affecting real people in healthcare, manufacturing and logistics. I've
                    done a little seed investing and advisory work - though I'm not actively looking
                    for new investments or roles.
                </li>
				<li><b>Security careers</b>, how builders, breakers and operators can grow and work 
                    together to advance security programs and help their organizations build securely.
                    I'll also bend your ear off about why the CISO role is a difficult chimera, with
                    responsibilities that naturally fall under the CTO, GC and COO - with competing
                    interests and few folks who can do all three well.
                </li>
			</ul>
			
			<h2>So...</h2>
			<p>
				If those topics are of interest to you, I'm always interested in comparing notes and
                stories. I'm not hard to find - look for me in Brooklyn, at Hacker Summer Camp, Summercon,
                fwd:cloudsec or on the Internet.
